# ECommerce-recommendation-system
In this project, I build a recommendation system for the Spotify app. <br>
The attachments contain a record of playbacks among about 2000 users and close to 20,000 artists.<br>
I used information from the social network describing user connections to build the recommendation system.<br>
Based on this data, I predict the number of times A particular user will hear a specific artist.
